# Analysis of Essentia models on the MTG Jamendo dataset

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to run the notebook correctly the user has to install python and the following modules: numpy, essentia. 
All the module will be directly imported runnign the notebook
Essentia will be installed directly running the notebook.
