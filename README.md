# Analysis of Essentia models on the MTG Jamendo dataset

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to run the notebook the following modules are necessary: numpy, essentia.

All the module will be directly imported running the notebook.

Essentia will be installed directly running the notebook.

## Open the notebok in Google Colab

The notebook can be directly open from Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RonFrancesca/Analysis_Essentia_models-MTG_Jamendo-dataset/blob/master/LargeScale_Dataset_Classification.ipynb)

Read the Notebook instruction to properly change directories paths and run the notebook correctly.

## Clone or Download the repository 

If the user wants a local copy of the notebook, clone or download the reposiotry.
It contains a Google Colab notebook, please read the Notebook instruction to properly change directories paths and run the notebook correctly.

Command to clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RonFrancesca/Analysis_Essentia_models-MTG_Jamendo-dataset.git
```
Once the notebook is installed, open it from google colab and follow the instruction to configure it correctly.
